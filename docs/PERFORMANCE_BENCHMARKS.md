# Performance Benchmarks

Tracks memory usage, recursion time, and throughput efficiency.

## 🧠 Benchmark Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Recursion Time | Total runtime per generation cycle |
| Cache Hits | Number of reused modules |
| Memory Usage | RAM consumption in MB |
| Semantic Stability | Avg delta between iterations |

Benchmarks are recorded in `ai_memory/benchmark_tracker.py` and displayed in the CLI dashboard.
