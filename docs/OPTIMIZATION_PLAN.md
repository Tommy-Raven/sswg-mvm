# Optimization & System Evolution Plan

This document tracks ongoing optimization efforts by phase.

| Phase | Focus Area | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **1 — Core Stability** | Add RecursionManager & exception tiers | Prevent infinite loops and improve runtime safety. | 🟡 Planned |
| **2 — Semantic Intelligence** | Add semantic delta scoring | Stop recursion intelligently when output stabilizes. | 🟡 Planned |
| **3 — Performance Optimization** | Add caching and GC triggers | Reduce runtime and memory overhead. | 🟡 Planned |
| **4 — Scalability** | Async/multithreaded execution | Parallel generation for multiple workflows. | 🟡 Planned |
| **5 — Monitoring** | Telemetry + structured logs | Real-time recursion analysis and traceability. | 🟡 Planned |
| **6 — Validation** | Regression and schema tracking | Maintain stability and version compatibility. | 🟡 Planned |
| **7 — Visualization** | Graphviz & Mermaid integration | Auto-generate workflow process diagrams. | 🟡 Planned |
| **8 — Adaptive Learning** | Add memory persistence | Enable the system to “learn” from prior runs. | 🟡 Planned |
