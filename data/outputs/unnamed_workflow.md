# Meta-Reflection Workflow

**Workflow ID:** `unnamed_workflow`

**Objective:** A recursive self-assessment process for AI systems or educators to evaluate their own learning frameworks.

## Phases
### P1
- Collect system outputs or learner artifacts
- Identify recurring patterns of success or error
- Document areas of cognitive or procedural bias
### P2
- Map observed trends to underlying causes
- Cross-compare current strategies with intended design goals
- Redefine or merge overlapping conceptual structures
### P3
- Regenerate improved frameworks using recursive synthesis
- Archive obsolete models with annotation of lessons learned
- Validate new models through internal feedback or peer testing

## Evaluation
- **notes**: ['Schema validation reported issues; see logs for details.']
