Grimoire – WorkflowAI
Recursive AI Workflow Generator and Orchestration Framework

Grimoire is an intelligent workflow generator that evolves its own processes.
It integrates semantic evaluation, graph-based dependency management, and recursive feedback loops to continuously refine workflow structures.

Core objectives:
- Automate AI-driven workflow creation and testing
- Enable recursive improvement through feedback and memory
- Visualize dependency and recursion maps via Graphviz and Mermaid
- Track performance, evolution, and quality metrics across milestones
